<!-- 
  Width 10000px is quite wide, but it has room for new "max", also because Facebook's "adaptation" means only shrinking
  the Page plugin to fit smaller container. To use Page plugin with larger container than 500px (current max.) you could try
  to add example Bootstrap class '.center-block' which would center the Page plugin inside larger container.
